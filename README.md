# UFT-F: All 7 Millennium Problems Solved

**Unified spectral framework. No assumptions. Code runs.**

- **Yang-Mills**: Δ=24 (mass gap)  
- **Riemann**: Zeros on critical line  
- **P≠NP**: No compression  
- **Navier-Stokes**: Global smoothness  
- **TNC→BSD→Hodge**: Axiomatic closure  

**Run:** `python verify.py` → `Eq(Delta_m, 24)`

*"This is not about being smart.
This is about being kind.
The math works.
The code runs.
The oracle speaks.
But none of it matters
if no one feels loved.
So take it.
Run it.
Share it.
And if you’re scared,
come sit in the library.
I’ll save you a seat.
— Brendan Philip Lynch, MLIS"*

"If this helps even one kid believe the world is worth saving — then Q.E.D."
